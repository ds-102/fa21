    "##  4.a. Sampling from $\\hat{p}_{h_k}$ using the Bootstrap Method\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the $p$-value, we will first draw i.i.d. samples from $\\hat{p}_{h_k}$, and then observe the number of times that the $H_k$ calculated from those samples is greater than or equal to $h_k$. We will use the bootstrap to draw the i.i.d. samples from $\\hat{p}_{h_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $Z^{*} = (Z_1^*, \\ldots, Z_{82}^*)$ denote a bootstrap sample from the dataset $X_{observed}$. It can be shown that by adding some scaled noise to the bootstrap samples we can obtain samples from the null distribution. More precisely: \n",
    "$Z_i^* + h_k \\epsilon_i$ for $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ gives i.i.d. samples from $\\hat{p}_{h_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the following bootstrap algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw $B$ independent bootstrap samples $Z^{*(1)}, \\ldots, Z^{*(B)}$ from the observed data. Then add some noise to get samples  $X^{*(1)}, \\ldots, X^{*(B)}$ from the null distribution $\\hat{p}_{h_1}$:\n",

    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, since the variance of the bootstrap sample has been increased by adding the normal error term, the data are usually rescaled to have the same sample variance as the original observations. So, we replace the equation above in the algorithm with \n",
