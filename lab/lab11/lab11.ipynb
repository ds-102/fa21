For the purposes of this lab, we will instead *simulate* a  privacy-sensitive dataset that contains the drug usage of the individuals admitted to the hospital. We will generate a dataset $X = \\{X_1, . . . , X_N \\}$ where each $X_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}^d$ represents an individual admitted to the hospital, and $X_{i,j}$ is 1 if the individual abuses drug $j$ and 0 otherwise. Since drug use is a sensitive topic, it would certainly be a privacy problem if such a dataset $X$ containing the drug usage of individuals admitted to the hospital were made public (and it would likely violate [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html)). \n",

This applies to the individuals in the dataset we generated: removing any individual from the data should not change our mean estimate that much. Otherwise, it may be possible to recover the drug usage of an individual based on a mean estimate that includes the individual and another mean estimate that doesn't include the individual.\n",

    "2. **Algorithm 2: Laplace mechanism:** To introduce differential privacy, we can apply the Laplace mechanism that we went over in Discussion 13.

    "3. **Algorithm 3: Locally differentially private Laplace mechanism:** another way to introduce differential privacy is to make the data locally differentially private. In the above Algorithm 2, we added a single noise parameter $\\xi_{\\epsilon}$ to the non-private estimate $f(X)$. Rather than adding noise to the aggregated $f(X)$, we could also add noise to each sensitive bit individually, $X_i$. $$\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathcal{A}(X) = f(X + \\xi_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i + \\xi_{\\epsilon}^i ).$$ We will also go over this algorithm in more detail later in the lab.\n",

The difference between Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 is that Algorithm 3 introduces more noise overall by introducing noise $\\xi_{\\epsilon}^i$ into each row. However, the local approach of Algorithm 3 ensures privacy even if we don't trust the person or program calculating $f(X)$ in Algorithm 2."
