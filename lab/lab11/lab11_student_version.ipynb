For the purposes of this lab, we will instead *simulate* a  privacy-sensitive dataset that contains the drug usage of the individuals admitted to the hospital. We will generate a dataset $X = \\{X_1, . . . , X_N \\}$ where each $X_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}^d$ represents an individual admitted to the hospital, and $X_{i,j}$ is 1 if the individual abuses drug $j$ and 0 otherwise. Since drug use is a sensitive topic, it would certainly be a privacy problem if such a dataset $X$ containing the drug usage of individuals admitted to the hospital were made public (and it would likely violate [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html)). \n",

We draw $$X_{i,j} \\sim Bernoulli(p_j)$$ independently for all $i = 1,...,N$ and for all $j = 1,...,d$. This results in a set of hypothetical individuals $X_1,...,X_N$ where the marginal counts $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N X_{i,j}$ yield approximately the correct drug use frequencies to match the NEDREDV data.

    "their personal information cannot be recovered from the results of either removing or adding them to the study. This applies to the individuals in the dataset we generated: removing any individual from the data should not change our mean estimate that much. Otherwise, it may be possible to recover the drug usage of an individual based on a mean estimate that includes the individual and another mean estimate that doesn't include the individual.\n",

    "For two datasets $X$ and $X'$ which differ in only one entry (e.g., differing in one individual), an $\\epsilon$-**differentially private algorithm** $\\mathcal{A}$ satisfies:\n",

    "\n",
    "for all possible output values $a$ of the algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$. In words, the probability of seeing any given output of a differentially private algorithm doesn't change much by replacing any one entry in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore three algorithms for estimating the mean in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithm 1: Non-private:** we will simply take the sample mean of the given data $X$, $$\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathcal{A}(X) = f(X) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i.$$ This is not differentially private: we can recover the drug usage of an individual if we estimate the mean before and after removing the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithm 2: Laplace mechanism:** To introduce differential privacy, we can apply the Laplace mechanism. Given the non-private estimator $f(X)$, we can add noise $\\xi_{\\epsilon}$: $$\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathcal{A}(X) = f(X) + \\xi_{\\epsilon} = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i\\right) + \\xi_{\\epsilon}.$$ We will go over this algorithm in more detail later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm 3: Locally differentially private Laplace mechanism:** another way to introduce differential privacy is to make the data locally differentially private. In the above Algorithm 2, we added a single noise parameter $\\xi_{\\epsilon}$ to the non-private estimate $f(X)$. Rather than adding noise to the aggregated $f(X)$, we could also add noise to each sensitive bit individually, $X_i$. $$\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathcal{A}(X) = f(X + \\xi_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i + \\xi_{\\epsilon}^i ).$$ We will also go over this algorithm in more detail later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 result in estimators $\\hat{\\theta}$ that are $\\epsilon$-differentially private. The difference between Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 is that Algorithm 3 introduces more noise overall by introducing noise $\\xi_{\\epsilon}^i$ into each row. However, the local approach of Algorithm 3 ensures privacy even if we don't trust the person or program calculating $f(X)$ in Algorithm 2."
