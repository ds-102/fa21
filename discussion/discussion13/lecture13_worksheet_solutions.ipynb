    "**Solution**: A spurious correlation is one that happens by pure chance, such as most of the examples from http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations. On the other hand, some correlations are indeed real: size of your palms is negatively correlated with how long you live, but this is not causal. Instead, there's a confounder: women tend to have smaller palms, and also to live longer."
