    "Given a simple linear regression $Y = \\alpha + \\beta X + \\epsilon$, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = \\textrm{Cov}(\\epsilon,X) = 0$, the coefficient of determination $r^2$ is defined as $r^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\textrm{Var}(\\epsilon)}{\\textrm{Var}(Y)}$. In other words, it is the fraction of variance of $Y$ explained by $X$. This seems to offer yet another measure of the association between two variables.\n",
